# LiberTEM-schema
Metadata schema for keeping parameters consistent within the LiberTEM ecosystem and link it with other metadata schemas.

## Versioning

For backwards compatibility and consistency a dependency on this package should
always contain a constraint on the major version, such as ">=0,<1". Minor
releases preserve compatibility and only add new features, while point releases
only resolve technical issues.

This project is still experimental and may change without notice until it is sufficiently stable.
